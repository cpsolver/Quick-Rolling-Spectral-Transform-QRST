Quick Rolling Spectral Transform (TM) (QRST) algorithmn

The name "Quick Rolling Spectral Transform" is trademarked (2010) by Richard Fobes at www.SolutionsCreative.com to prevent the name from being co-opted.

This software is still in development and does not yet yield an accurate spectral transform.  As further development occurs -- on an open-source basis -- the accuracy is expected to increase.

Although this code is written in the C/C++ language for debugging and prototyping purposes, this code is intended to be ported to other languages (including Web Assembly) and -- if properly licensed -- hardware environments such as an IP core or Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).

Algorithm description:

Basically the QRST spectral-transform algorithm low-pass filters and high-pass filters an audio waveform into octaves.  Within each octave, the amplitude of one cycle is measured using signal values at five adjacent samples, and phases shifts are followed to determine the wavelength of the cycles at that octave.  The results from each octave are produced twice as often as the resuls at the next-lower octave.  A second interleaved sequence of octaves is also analyzed to follow a signal as it shifts frequency between adjacent octaves.
